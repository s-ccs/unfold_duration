  abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate \$t\$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

  abstract = {Neural responses in visual cortex adapt to prolonged and repeated stimuli. While adaptation occurs across the visual cortex, it is unclear how adaptation patterns and computational mechanisms differ across the visual hierarchy. Here we characterize two signatures of short-term neural adaptation in time-varying intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data collected while participants viewed naturalistic image categories varying in duration and repetition interval. Ventral- and lateral-occipitotemporal cortex exhibit slower and prolonged adaptation to single stimuli and slower recovery from adaptation to repeated stimuli compared to V1-V3. For category-selective electrodes, recovery from adaptation is slower for preferred than non-preferred stimuli. To model neural adaptation we augment our delayed divisive normalization (DN) model by scaling the input strength as a function of stimulus category, enabling the model to accurately predict neural responses across multiple image categories. The model fits suggest that differences in adaptation patterns arise from slower normalization dynamics in higher visual areas interacting with differences in input strength resulting from category selectivity. Our results reveal systematic differences in temporal adaptation of neural population responses between lower and higher visual brain areas and show that a single computational model of history-dependent normalization dynamics, fit with area-specific parameters, accounts for these differences.},

It is popular to model this task-evoked pupil response as a linear transformation of event-locked impulses, whose amplitudes are used as estimates of arousal. We show that this model is incorrect and propose an alternative model based on the physiological finding that a common neural input drives saccades and pupil size. The estimates of arousal from our model agreed with key predictions: Arousal scaled with task difficulty and behavioral performance but was invariant to small differences in trial duration. Moreover, the model offers a unified explanation for a wide range of phenomena: entrainment of pupil size and saccades to task timing, modulation of pupil response amplitude and noise with task difficulty, reaction time--dependent modulation of pupil response timing and amplitude, a constrictory pupil response time-locked to saccades, and task-dependent distortion of this saccade-locked pupil response.},

Here, we aimed at contributing to this debate by coregistering eye movements and EEG while participants viewed photographs of indoor scenes that contained a semantically consistent or inconsistent target object. Linear deconvolution modeling was used to analyze the ERPs evoked by scene onset as well as the fixation-related potentials (FRPs) elicited by the fixation on the target object (t) and by the preceding fixation (t - 1). Object-scene consistency did not influence the probability of immediate target fixation or the ERP evoked by scene onset, which suggests that object-scene semantics was not accessed immediately. However, during the subsequent scene exploration, inconsistent objects were prioritized over consistent objects in extrafoveal vision (i.e., looked at earlier) and were more effortful to process in foveal vision (i.e., looked at longer). In FRPs, we demonstrate a fixation-related N300/N400 effect, whereby inconsistent objects elicit a larger frontocentral negativity than consistent objects. In line with the behavioral findings, this effect was already seen in FRPs aligned to the pretarget fixation t - 1 and persisted throughout fixation t, indicating that the extraction of object semantics can already begin in extrafoveal vision. Taken together, the results emphasize the usefulness of combined EEG/eye movement recordings for understanding the mechanisms of object-scene integration during natural viewing.},

  abstract = {Brain-electric correlates of reading have traditionally been studied with word-by-word presentation, a condition that eliminates important aspects of the normal reading process and precludes direct comparisons between neural activity and oculomotor behavior. In the present study, we investigated effects of word predictability on eye movements (EM) and fixation- related brain potentials (FRPs) during natural sentence reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and EM (via video-based eye tracking) were recorded simultaneously while subjects read heterogeneous German sentences, moving their eyes freely over the text. FRPs were time- locked to first-pass reading fixations and analyzed according to the cloze probability of the currently fixated word. We replicated robust effects of word predictability on EMs and the N400 component in FRPs. The data were then used to model the relation among fixation duration, gaze duration, and N400 amplitude, and to trace the time course of EEG effects relative to effects in EM behavior. In an extended Methodological Discussion section, we review four technical and data-analytical problems that need to be addressed when FRPs are recorded in free-viewing situations (such as reading, visual search, or scene perception) and propose solutions. Results suggest that EEG recordings during normal vision are feasible and useful to consolidate findings from EEG and eye-tracking studies.    Journal of Experimental Psychology: General},

  abstract = {Electrophysiological research with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is increasingly moving from simple, strictly orthogonal stimulation paradigms towards more complex, quasi-experimental designs and naturalistic situations that involve fast, multisensory stimulation and complex motor behavior. As a result, electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often overlap with each other. In addition, the recorded neural activity is typically modulated by numerous covariates, which influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation experiments, and mobile brain/body imaging studies. However, even ``traditional,'' highly controlled ERP datasets often contain a hidden mix of overlapping activity (e.g., from stimulus onsets, involuntary microsaccades, or button presses) and it is helpful or even necessary to disentangle these components for a correct interpretation of the results. In this paper, we introduce unfold, a powerful, yet easy-to-use MATLAB toolbox for regression-based EEG analyses that combines existing concepts of massive univariate modeling (``regression-ERPs''), linear deconvolution modeling, and non-linear modeling with the generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible analysis framework. The toolbox is modular, compatible with EEGLAB and can handle even large datasets efficiently. It also includes advanced options for regularization and the use of temporal basis functions (e.g., Fourier sets). We illustrate the advantages of this approach for simulated data as well as data from a standard face recognition experiment. In addition to traditional and non-conventional EEG/ERP designs, unfold can also be applied to other overlapping physiological signals, such as pupillary or electrodermal responses. It is available as open-source software at http://www.unfoldtoolbox.org.},

The balance of these two processes determines the distribution of fixation durations. Using a gaze-contingent paradigm, we experimentally interrupt this process to probe its state. Here, we developed a guided-viewing task where only a single 3{$^\circ$} aperture of an image (``bubble'') is displayed. Subjects had to fixate the bubble for an experimentally controlled time (forced fixation time). Then, the previously fixated bubble disappeared, and one to five bubbles emerged at different locations. The subjects freely selected one of these by performing a saccade toward it. By repeating this procedure, the subjects explored the image. We modeled the resulting saccadic reaction times (choice times) from bubble offset to saccade onset using a Bayesian linear mixed model. We observed an exponential decay between the forced fixation time and the choice time: Short fixation durations elicited longer choice times. In trials with multiple bubbles, the choice time increased monotonically with the number of possible future targets. Additionally, we found only weak influences of the saccade amplitude, low-level stimulus properties, and saccade angle on the choice times. The exponential decay of the choice times suggests that the sampling and processing of the current stimulus were exhausted for long fixation durations, biasing toward faster exploration. This observation also shows that the decision process took into account processing demands at the current fixation location.},

  abstract = {Here we present an application of an EEG processing pipeline customizing EEGLAB and FieldTrip functions, specifically optimized to flexibly analyze EEG data based on single trial information. The key component of our approach is to create a comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all participants maintaining the original order of recording. This allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any information available in a behavioral data structure matched with the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible in traditional ERP approaches without substantial effort. We further provide easily adaptable scripts for performing cluster-based permutation tests (as implemented in FieldTrip), as a more robust alternative to traditional omnibus ANOVAs. Our approach is particularly advantageous for data with parametric within-subject covariates (e.g. performance) and/or multiple complex stimuli (such as words, faces or objects) that vary in features affecting cognitive processes and ERPs (such as word frequency, salience or familiarity), which are sometimes hard to control experimentally or might themselves constitute variables of interest. The present dataset was recorded from 40 participants who performed a visual search task on previously unfamiliar objects, presented either visually intact or blurred. MATLAB as well as R scripts are provided that can be adapted to different datasets.},

  abstract = {A large body of work has identified characteristic neural signatures of value-based decision-making. A core circuit has been shown to track the values of options under consideration, and the dynamics of neural activity associated with this circuit have been found to closely resemble the ramping evidence accumulation process believed to underpin goal-directed choice, most notably in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, recent neuroimaging studies suggest that value-based choices trigger multiple value-related neural signatures, some of which are unrelated to decision-making per se but instead reflect reflexive affective reactions to one's options. Here, we use the temporal resolution of EEG to test whether choice-independent value signals could be dissociated from well-known temporal signatures of the choice process. We show that EEG activity during value-based choice can be decomposed into distinct spatiotemporal clusters, one stimulus-locked (associated with the affective salience of a choice set) and one response-locked (associated with the difficulty of selecting the best option). We show that neither of these clusters meet the criteria for an evidence accumulation signal. Instead, and to our surprise, we found that stimulus-locked activity can mimic an evidence accumulation process when aligned to the response (as with the CPP). In this dataset and a second one that uses a more traditional perceptual decision-making task, we show that the CPP's apparent pattern of evidence accumulation disappears when stimulus-locked and response-locked signals are accounted for jointly. Collectively, our findings show that neural signatures of value can reflect choiceindependent processes that when analyzed using standard approaches, can look deceptively like evidence accumulation. Significance Statement To choose, people must evaluate their options and select between them. Selection is well described by a process of accumulating evidence up to some threshold, with an electrophysiological signature in the centroparietal positivity (CPP). However, decision-making also gives rise to value signals reflecting affective reactions and other selection-unrelated processes. Measuring EEG while participants made value-based choices, we identified two spatiotemporally distinct value signals, neither reflecting evidence accumulation. Instead, we show that evidence accumulation signals found in the CPP can arise artifactually from overlapping stimulus- and response-related activity. These findings call for a significant reexamination of established links between neural and computational mechanisms of choice, while inviting deeper consideration of the array of cognitive and affective processes that occur in parallel.},

Although powerful, the employed paradigms are far from what constitutes natural vision. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ecologically more valid experimental paradigms using natural viewing behaviour, by combining a free viewing paradigm on natural scenes, free of photographer bias, with advanced data processing techniques that correct for overlap effects and co-varying non-linear dependencies of multiple eye movement parameters. We validate this approach by replicating classic N170 effects in neural responses, triggered by fixation onsets (fixation event-related potentials [fERPs]). Importantly, besides finding a strong correlation between both experiments, our more natural stimulus paradigm yielded smaller variability between subjects than the classic setup. Moving beyond classic temporal and spatial effect locations, our experiment furthermore revealed previously unknown signatures of face processing: This includes category-specific modulation of the event-related potential (ERP)'s amplitude even before fixation onset, as well as adaptation effects across subsequent fixations depending on their history.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinicians are sometimes advised to make decisions using thresholds in measured variables, derived from prognostic studies. OBJECTIVES: We studied why there are conflicting apparently-optimal prognostic thresholds, for example in exercise peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), ejection fraction (EF), and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in heart failure (HF). DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds in heart failure, published between 1990 and 2010, listed on Pubmed. METHODS: First, we examined studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds. Second, we created repeated simulations of 1500 patients to identify whether an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold indicates step change in risk. RESULTS: 33 studies (8946 patients) tested a pVO2 threshold. 18 found it prognostically significant: the actual reported threshold ranged widely (10-18 ml/kg/min) but was overwhelmingly controlled by the individual study population's mean pVO2 (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.86, p{$<$}0.00001). In contrast, the 15 negative publications were testing thresholds 199\% further from their means (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.0001). Likewise, of 35 EF studies (10220 patients), the thresholds in the 22 positive reports were strongly determined by study means (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.90, p{$<$}0.0001). Similarly, in the 19 positives of 20 BNP studies (9725 patients): r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.86 (p{$<$}0.0001). Second, survival simulations always discovered a "most significant" threshold, even when there was definitely no step change in mortality. With linear increase in risk, the apparently-optimal threshold was always near the sample mean (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.99, p{$<$}0.001). LIMITATIONS: This study cannot report the best threshold for any of these variables; instead it explains how common clinical research procedures routinely produce false thresholds. KEY FINDINGS: First, shifting (and/or disappearance) of an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold is strongly determined by studies' average pVO2, EF or BNP. Second, apparently-optimal thresholds always appear, even with no step in prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Emphatic therapeutic guidance based on thresholds from observational studies may be ill-founded. We should not assume that optimal thresholds, or any thresholds, exist.},

  abstract = {There is no complete solution for the problem of abuse of statistics, but methodological training needs to cover cognitive biases and other psychosocial factors affecting inferences. The present paper discusses 3 common cognitive distortions: 1) dichotomania, the compulsion to perceive quantities as dichotomous even when dichotomization is unnecessary and misleading, as in inferences based on whether a P value is ``statistically significant''; 2) nullism, the tendency to privilege the hypothesis of no difference or no effect when there is no scientific basis for doing so, as when testing only the null hypothesis; and 3) statistical reification, treating hypothetical data distributions and statistical models as if they reflect known physical laws rather than speculative assumptions for thought experiments. As commonly misused, null-hypothesis significance testing combines these cognitive problems to produce highly distorted interpretation and reporting of study results. Interval estimation has so far proven to be an inadequate solution because it involves dichotomization, an avenue for nullism. Sensitivity and bias analyses have been proposed to address reproducibility problems (Am J Epidemiol. 2017;186(6):646--647); these methods can indeed address reification, but they can also introduce new distortions via misleading specifications for bias parameters. P values can be reframed to lessen distortions by presenting them without reference to a cutoff, providing them for relevant alternatives to the null, and recognizing their dependence on all assumptions used in their computation; they nonetheless require rescaling for measuring evidence. I conclude that methodological development and training should go beyond coverage of mechanistic biases (e.g., confounding, selection bias, measurement error) to cover distortions of conclusions produced by statistical methods and psychosocial forces.},

  abstract = {Neural responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including subadditive temporal summation, response reduction with repeated or sustained stimuli (adaptation), and slower dynamics at low contrast. These phenomena are often studied independently. Here, we demonstrate these phenomena within the same experiment and model the underlying neural computations with a single computational model. We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic recordings from patients presented with stimuli that varied in duration, interstimulus interval (ISI) and contrast. Aggregating data across patients from both sexes yielded 98 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1--V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several nonlinear features. Peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations, the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs, and response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model composed of a small set of canonical neuronal operations, that is, linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sensory inputs and neural responses change continuously over time. It is especially challenging to understand a system that has both dynamic inputs and outputs. Here, we use a computational modeling approach that specifies computations to convert a time-varying input stimulus to a neural response time course, and we use this to predict neural activity measured in the human visual cortex. We show that this computational model predicts a wide variety of complex neural response shapes, which we induced experimentally by manipulating the duration, repetition, and contrast of visual stimuli. By comparing data and model predictions, we uncover systematic properties of temporal dynamics of neural signals, allowing us to better understand how the brain processes dynamic sensory information.},

  abstract = {Much of human behavior is governed by common processes that unfold over varying timescales. Standard event-related potential analysis assumes fixed-duration responses relative to experimental events. However, recent single-unit recordings in animals have revealed neural activity scales to span different durations during behaviors demanding flexible timing. Here, we employed a general linear modeling approach using a combination of fixed-duration and variable-duration regressors to unmix fixed-time and scaled-time components in human magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG) data. We use this to reveal consistent temporal scaling of human scalp--recorded potentials across four independent electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets, including interval perception, production, prediction, and value-based decision making. Between-trial variation in the temporally scaled response predicts between-trial variation in subject reaction times, demonstrating the relevance of this temporally scaled signal for temporal variation in behavior. Our results provide a general approach for studying flexibly timed behavior in the human brain.},

  abstract = {EEG correlates of a range of psycholinguistic word properties were used to investigate the time course of access to psycholinguistic information during visual word recognition. Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word--pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ms after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ms. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages ({$>$}200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.},

We conducted Stroop experiments and measured RT and pupil dilation. The results show a clear dissociation between RT and pupil dilation. We found the regular RT pattern-large interference and small, nonsignificant facilitation. In contrast, pupil dilation showed information conflict-larger pupil dilation to incongruent than to congruent and neutral conditions-and task conflict-larger pupil dilation to the congruent than to the neutral condition. Moreover, pupil indications for task conflict appeared earlier than indications for the information conflict. These results suggest that pupil changes could indicate conflict even in the absence of behavioral indications for the conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},

Here we test the hypothesis that such shifts in cognitive control may be influenced by changes in cognitive load related to stimulus predictability, and that these changes can be indexed by task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPR). We manipulated stimulus predictability using fixed stimulus sequences that were unknown to the participants in a Go/Switch task (requiring a switch response on 25\% of trials) while monitoring TEPR as a measure of cognitive load in 12 healthy adults. Results showed significant improvement in performance (reduced RT, increased efficiency) for repeated sequences compared to occasional deviant sequences (10\% probability) indicating that incidental learning of the predictable sequences facilitated performance. All behavioral measures varied between Switch and Go trials (RT, efficiency), however mean TEPR amplitude (mTEPR) and latency to maximum pupil dilation were particularly sensitive to Go/Switch. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that mTEPR indexes cognitive load, whereas TEPR latency indexes time to response selection, independent from response execution. The present study provides evidence that incidental pattern learning during response inhibition tasks may modulate several cognitive processes including cognitive load, effort, response selection and execution, which can in turn have differential effects on measures of performance. In particular, we demonstrate that reaction time may not be indicative of underlying cognitive load.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, animal neurophysiology research has made great strides towards explaining how the brain can enable adaptive action in the face of noisy sensory information. In particular, this work has identified neural signals that perform the role of a `decision variable' which integrates sensory information in favor of a particular outcome up to an action-triggering threshold, consistent with long-standing predictions from mathematical psychology. This has provoked an intensive search for similar neural processes at work in the human brain. In this paper we review the progress that has been made in tracing the dynamics of perceptual decision formation in humans using functional imaging and electrophysiology. We highlight some of the limitations that non-invasive recording techniques place on our ability to make definitive judgments regarding the role that specific signals play in decision making. Finally, we provide an overview of our own work in this area which has focussed on two perceptual tasks -- intensity change detection and motion discrimination -- performed under continuous-monitoring conditions, and highlight the insights gained thus far. We show that through simple paradigm design features such as avoiding sudden intensity transients at evidence onset, a neural instantiation of the theoretical decision variable can be directly traced in the form of a centro-parietal positivity (CPP) in the standard event-related potential (ERP). We recapitulate evidence for the domain-general nature of the CPP process, being divorced from the sensory and motor requirements of the task, and re-plot data of both tasks highlighting this aspect as well as its relationship to decision outcome and reaction time. We discuss the implications of these findings for mechanistically principled research on normal and abnormal decision making in humans.},

Motor cortical EPs may be directionally selective, but little is known concerning their relation to other aspects of motor behavior, such as task timing and performance. We recorded LFPs in motor cortex of two monkeys during performance of a precued arm-reaching task. A time cue at the start of each trial signaled delay duration and thereby the pace of the task and the available time for movement preparation. VEPs and MRPs were strongly modulated by the delay duration, VEPs being systematically larger in short-delay trials and MRPs larger in long-delay trials. Despite these systematic modulations related to the task timing, directional selectivity was similar in short and long trials. The behavioral reaction time was positively correlated with MRP size and negatively correlated with VEP size, within sessions. In addition, the behavioral performance improved across sessions, in parallel with a slow decrease in the size of VEPs and MRPs. Our results clearly show the strong influence of the behavioral context and performance on motor cortical population activity during movement preparation and execution.},

  abstract = {Research on brain-behaviour relationships often makes the implicit assumption that these derive from a co-variation of stochastic fluctuations in brain activity and performance across trials of an experiment. However, challenging this assumption, oscillatory brain activity, as well as indicators of performance, such as response speed, can show systematic trends with time on task. Here we tested whether time-on-task trends explain a range of relationships between oscillatory brain activity and response speed, accuracy as well as decision confidence. Thirty-six participants performed 900 trials of a two-alternative forced choice visual discrimination task with confidence ratings. Pre- and post-stimulus spectral power (1-40Hz) and aperiodic (i.e., non-oscillatory) components were compared across blocks of the experimental session and tested for relationships with behavioural performance. We found that time-on-task effects on oscillatory EEG activity were primarily localised within the alpha band, with alpha power increasing and peak alpha frequency decreasing over time, even when controlling for aperiodic contributions. Aperiodic, broadband activity on the other hand did not show time-on-task effects in our data set. Importantly, time-on-task effects in alpha frequency and power explained variability in single-trial reaction times, and controlling for time-on-task effectively removed these relationships. However, time-on-task effects did not affect other EEG signatures of behavioural performance, including post-stimulus predictors of single-trial decision confidence. Our results dissociate alpha-band brain-behaviour relationships that can be explained away by time-on-task from those that remain after accounting for it - thereby further specifying the potential functional roles of alpha in human visual perception.},

The present study investigated if similar cross-modal effects exist when attention is oriented to a point in time. Short (600 msec) and long (1200 msec) empty intervals, marked by a tactile onset and an auditory or a tactile offset marker, were presented. In each block, the participants had to attend one interval and one modality. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to auditory and tactile offset markers of attended as compared to unattended intervals were characterized by an enhancement of early negative deflections of the auditory and somatosensory ERPs (audition, 100--140 msec; touch, 130--180 msec) when audition or touch was task relevant, respectively. Similar effects were found for auditory stimuli when touch was task relevant. An additional reaction time experiment revealed faster responses to both auditory and tactile stimuli at the attended as compared to the unattended point in time, irrespective of which modality was primary. Both behavioral and ERP data show that attention can be focused on a point in time, which results in a more efficient processing of auditory and tactile stimuli. The ERP data further suggest that a relative enhancement at perceptual processing stages contributes to the processing advantage for temporally attended stimuli. The existence of cross-modal effects of temporal attention underlines the importance of time as a feature for binding input across different modalities.},

  abstract = {Response times (RTs) are often the main signal of interest in cognitive psychology but are often ignored in functional MRI (fMRI) analyses. In fMRI analysis the intensity of the signal serves as a proxy for the intensity of local neuronal activity, but changes in either the intensity or the duration of neuronal activity can yield identical fMRI signals. Therefore, if RTs are ignored and pair with neuronal durations, fMRI results claiming intensity differences may be confounded by RTs. We show how ignoring RTs goes beyond this confound, where longer RTs are paired with larger activation estimates, to lesser-known issues where RTs become confounds in group-level analyses and, surprisingly, how the RT confound can induce other artificial group-level associations with variables that are not related to the condition contrast or RTs. We propose a new time-series model to address these issues and encourage increasing focus on what the widespread RT-based signal represents.},

  abstract = {Co-registration of EEG and eye movement has promise for investigating perceptual processes in free viewing conditions, provided certain methodological challenges can be addressed. Most of these arise from the self-paced character of eye movements in free viewing conditions. Successive eye movements occur within short time intervals. Their evoked activity is likely to distort the EEG signal during fixation. Due to the non-uniform distribution of fixation durations, these distortions are systematic, survive across-trials averaging, and can become a source of confounding. We illustrate this problem with effects of sequential eye movements on the evoked potentials and time-frequency components of EEG and propose a solution based on matching of eye movement characteristics between experimental conditions. The proposal leads to a discussion of which eye movement characteristics are to be matched, depending on the EEG activity of interest. We also compare segmentation of EEG into saccade-related epochs relative to saccade and fixation onsets and discuss the problem of baseline selection and its solution. Further recommendations are given for implementing EEG-eye movement co-registration in free viewing conditions. By resolving some of the methodological problems involved, we aim to facilitate the transition from the traditional stimulus-response paradigm to the study of visual perception in more naturalistic conditions.},

  abstract = {Scene perception requires the orchestration of image- and task-related processes with oculomotor constraints. The present study was designed to investigate how these factors influence how long the eyes remain fixated on a given location. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used to test whether local image statistics (including luminance, luminance contrast, edge density, visual clutter, and the number of homogeneous segments), calculated for 1{$^\circ$} circular regions around fixation locations, modulate fixation durations, and how these effects depend on task-related control. Fixation durations and locations were recorded from 72 participants, each viewing 135 scenes under three different viewing instructions (memorization, preference judgment, and search). Along with the image-related predictors, the LMMs simultaneously considered a number of oculomotor and spatiotemporal covariates, including the amplitudes of the previous and next saccades, and viewing time. As a key finding, the local image features around the current fixation predicted this fixation's duration. For instance, greater luminance was associated with shorter fixation durations. Such immediacy effects were found for all three viewing tasks. Moreover, in the memorization and preference tasks, some evidence for successor effects emerged, such that some image characteristics of the upcoming location influenced how long the eyes stayed at the current location. In contrast, in the search task, scene processing was not distributed across fixation durations within the visual span. The LMM-based framework of analysis, applied to the control of fixation durations in scenes, suggests important constraints for models of scene perception and search, and for visual attention in general.},

  abstract = {Background Conventionally, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are obtained by averaging a number of single trials. This can be problematic due to trial-to-trial latency variability. Residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) was developed to decompose ERPs into component clusters with different latency variability and to re-synchronize the separated components into a reconstructed ERP. New method RIDE has been continuously upgraded and now converges to a robust version. We describe the principles of RIDE and detailed algorithms of the functional modules of a toolbox. We give recommendations and provide caveats for using RIDE from both methodological and psychological perspectives. Results RIDE was applied to several data samples to demonstrate its ability to decompose and reconstruct latency-variable components of ERPs and to retrieve single trial variability information. Different functionalities of RIDE were shown in appropriate examples. Comparison with existing methods RIDE employs several modules to achieve a robust decomposition of ERP. As main innovations RIDE (1) is able to extract components based on the combination of known event markers and estimated latencies, (2) prevents distortions much more effectively than previous methods based on least-square algorithms, and (3) allows time window confinements to target relevant components associated with sub-processes of interest. Conclusions RIDE is a convenient method that decomposes ERPs and provides single trial analysis, yielding rich information about sub-components, and that reconstructs ERPs, more closely reflecting the combined activity of single trial ERPs. The outcomes of RIDE provide new dimensions to study brain--behavior relationships based on EEG data.},

This book describes the ideas and procedures that underlie the analysis of signals produced by the brain. The aim is to understand how the brain works, in terms of its functional architecture and dynamics. This book provides the background and methodology for the analysis of all types of brain imaging data, from functional magnetic resonance imaging to magnetoencephalography. Critically, Statistical Parametric Mapping provides a widely accepted conceptual framework which allows treatment of all these different modalities. This rests on an understanding of the brain's functional anatomy and the way that measured signals are caused experimentally. The book takes the reader from the basic concepts underlying the analysis of neuroimaging data to cutting edge approaches that would be difficult to find in any other source. Critically, the material is presented in an incremental way so that the reader can understand the precedents for each new development. This book will be particularly useful to neuroscientists engaged in any form of brain mapping; who have to contend with the real-world problems of data analysis and understanding the techniques they are using. It is primarily a scientific treatment and a didactic introduction to the analysis of brain imaging data. It can be used as both a textbook for students and scientists starting to use the techniques, as well as a reference for practicing neuroscientists. The book also serves as a companion to the software packages that have been developed for brain imaging data analysis. An essential reference and companion for users of the SPM software Provides a complete description of the concepts and procedures entailed by the analysis of brain images Offers full didactic treatment of the basic mathematics behind the analysis of brain imaging data Stands as a compendium of all the advances in neuroimaging data analysis over the past decade Adopts an easy to understand and incremental approach that takes the reader from basic statistics to state of the art approaches such as Variational Bayes Structured treatment of data analysis issues that links different modalities and models Includes a series of appendices and tutorial-style chapters that makes even the most sophisticated approaches accessible},

We have empirically evaluated the technique in an experiment where the task requires detecting a target in the presence of distractors. We have also studied the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolving power of averages with and without binning. Results indicate that the method produces clearer representations of ERPs than either stimulus-locked and response-locked averaging, revealing finer details of ERPs and helping in the evaluation of the amplitude and latency of ERP waves.

  abstract = {Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain's capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain's sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain's sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects' behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners' ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain's ability to process stochastic sound sequences.},

Both, decision making and the difference between rare and frequent stimuli (oddball effect) are described to affect pupil dilation. Surprisingly though, conjoint systematic pupillometric investigations into both factors are still rare. In two experiments, both factors as well as their interplay were investigated. Participants completed a sequential letter matching task. In this task, stimulus probability and letter matching (decision making) were manipulated independently. As dependent variables, pupil dilation and reaction time were assessed. Results suggest a clearly larger pupil dilation for target than for distractor letters, even when targets were frequent and distractors rare. When considering the data structure best, no main effect of stimulus probability was found, instead, oddball effects only emerged when stimuli were goal-relevant to participants. The results are discussed in the light of common theoretical concepts of decision making and stimulus probability. Finally, relating theories of each factor, we propose an integrated framework for effects of decision making and stimulus features on pupil dilation. We assume a sequential mechanism during which incoming stimuli are decided upon regarding their goal relevance and, about 200 ms later, relevant stimuli are appraised regarding their value.},

  abstract = {Two event-related potential (ERP) components are commonly observed in recognition memory tasks: the Frontal Negativity (FN400) and the Late Positive Component (LPC). These components are widely interpreted as neural correlates of familiarity and recollection, respectively. However, the interpretation of LPC effects is complicated by inconsistent results regarding the timing of ERP amplitude differences. There are also mixed findings regarding how LPC amplitudes covary with decision confidence. Critically, LPC effects have almost always been measured using fixed time windows relative to memory probe stimulus onset, yet it has not been determined whether LPC effects are time locked to the stimulus or the recognition memory decision. To investigate this, we analysed a large (n~=~132) existing dataset recorded during recognition memory tasks with old/new decisions followed by post-decisional confidence ratings. We used ERP deconvolution to disentangle contributions to LPC effects (defined as differences between hits and correct rejections) that were time locked to either the stimulus or the vocal old/new response. We identified a left-lateralised parietal LPC effect that was time locked to the vocal response rather than probe stimulus onset. We also isolated a response-locked, midline parietal ERP correlate of confidence that influenced measures of LPC amplitudes at left parietal electrodes. Our findings demonstrate that, contrary to widespread assumptions, the LPC effect is time locked to the recognition memory decision and is best measured using response-locked ERPs. By extension, differences in response time distributions across conditions of interest may lead to substantial measurement biases when analysing stimulus-locked ERPs. Our findings highlight important confounding factors that further complicate the interpretation of existing stimulus-locked LPC effects as neural correlates of recollection. We recommend that future studies adopt our analytic approach to better isolate LPC effects and their sensitivity to manipulations in recognition memory tasks.},

  abstract = {While viewing a scene, the eyes are attracted to salient stimuli. We set out to identify the brain signals controlling this process. In a contour integration task, in which participants searched for a collinear contour in a field of randomly oriented Gabor elements, a previously established model was applied to calculate a visual saliency value for each fixation location. We studied brain activity related to the modeled saliency values, using coregistered eye tracking and EEG. To disentangle EEG signals reflecting salience in free viewing from overlapping EEG responses to sequential eye movements, we adopted generalized additive mixed modeling (GAMM) to single epochs of saccade-related EEG. We found that, when saliency at the next fixation location was high, amplitude of the presaccadic EEG activity was low. Since presaccadic activity reflects covert attention to the saccade target, our results indicate that larger attentional effort is needed for selecting less salient saccade targets than more salient ones. This effect was prominent in contour-present conditions (half of the trials), but ambiguous in the contour-absent condition. Presaccadic EEG activity may thus be indicative of bottom-up factors in saccade guidance. The results underscore the utility of GAMM for EEG---eye movement coregistration research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The human brain is capable of using statistical regularities to predict future inputs. In the real world, such inputs typically comprise a collection of objects (e.g. a forest constitutes numerous trees). The present study aimed to investigate whether perceptual anticipation relies on lower-level or higher-level information. Specifically, we examined whether the human brain anticipates each object in a scene individually or anticipates the scene as a whole. To explore this issue, we first trained participants to associate co-occurring objects within fixed spatial arrangements. Meanwhile, participants implicitly learned temporal regularities between these displays. We then tested how spatial and temporal violations of the structure modulated behavior and neural activity in the visual system using fMRI. We found that participants only showed a behavioral advantage of temporal regularities when the displays conformed to their previously learned spatial structure, demonstrating that humans form configuration-specific temporal expectations instead of predicting individual objects. Similarly, we found suppression of neural responses for temporally expected compared with temporally unexpected objects in lateral occipital cortex only when the objects were embedded within expected configurations. Overall, our findings indicate that humans form expectations about object configurations, demonstrating the prioritization of higher-level over lower-level information in temporal expectation.},

  abstract = {Background Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used measures of performance in experimental psychology, yet relatively few fMRI studies have included trial-by-trial differences in RT as a predictor variable in their analyses. Using a multi-study approach, we investigated whether there are brain regions that show a general relationship between trial-by-trial RT variability and activation across a range of cognitive tasks. Methodology/Principal Findings The relation between trial-by-trial differences in RT and brain activation was modeled in five different fMRI datasets spanning a range of experimental tasks and stimulus modalities. Three main findings were identified. First, in a widely distributed set of gray and white matter regions, activation was delayed on trials with long RTs relative to short RTs, suggesting delayed initiation of underlying physiological processes. Second, in lateral and medial frontal regions, activation showed a ``time-on-task'' effect, increasing linearly as a function of RT. Finally, RT variability reliably modulated the BOLD signal not only in gray matter but also in diffuse regions of white matter. Conclusions/Significance The results highlight the importance of modeling trial-by-trial RT in fMRI analyses and raise the possibility that RT variability may provide a powerful probe for investigating the previously elusive white matter BOLD signal.},

  abstract = {Free gaze and moving images are typically avoided in EEG experiments due to the expected generation of artifacts and noise. Yet for a growing number of research questions, loosening these rigorous restrictions would be beneficial. Among these is research on visual aesthetic experiences, which often involve open-ended exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we systematically compare the effect of conservative vs. more liberal experimental settings on various measures of behavior, brain activity and physiology in an aesthetic rating task. Our primary aim was to assess EEG signal quality. 43 participants either maintained fixation or were allowed to gaze freely, and viewed either static images or dynamic (video) stimuli consisting of dance performances or nature scenes. A passive auditory background task (auditory steady-state response; ASSR) was added as a proxy measure for overall EEG recording quality. We recorded EEG, ECG and eyetracking data, and participants rated their aesthetic preference and state of boredom on each trial. Whereas both behavioral ratings and gaze behavior were affected by task and stimulus manipulations, EEG SNR was barely affected and generally robust across all conditions, despite only minimal preprocessing and no trial rejection. In particular, we show that using video stimuli does not necessarily result in lower EEG quality and can, on the contrary, significantly reduce eye movements while increasing both the participants' aesthetic response and general task engagement. We see these as encouraging results indicating that -- at least in the lab -- more liberal experimental conditions can be adopted without significant loss of signal quality. HighlightsWe assess trade-offs between EEG quality and behavior for common task constraintsInvestigated constraints: fixation task vs. free gaze, and video vs. static stimuliMeasures: EEG quality, aesthetic preference, task engagement, gaze and heart rateVideo stimuli reduce eye movements, increase engagement and do not affect EEG SNRFixation task only slightly increases SNR and does not influence ratings},

The currently most promising measures are perturbational complexity index (PCI), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE) and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). However, all these measures were tested on states where unconsciousness was merely assumed. The current thesis sought to investigate these measures by applying them to data from awake and anesthetized states, while controlling for experiences in unresponsive states. For this we collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data with applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) from participants while they were awake and under anesthesia. Importantly, participants were woken up intermittently, in order to additional experience reports. In nearly 70\% of the awakenings participants reported having dreams. Additionally, results showed a significant difference between measures for awake and anesthetized states, albeit for LZC, ACE and SCE only under eyes open condition during awake state. Further, LZC, ACE and SCE correlated with the vividness of reports given by subjects, while PCIST did not. While our results indicate that current measures of consciousness can distinguish between awake and non-responsive states, it is not clear whether this truly reflects unconsciousness or what part of consciousness these measures reflect.},

  abstract = {The usual event-related potential (ERP) estimation is the average across epochs time-locked on stimuli of interest. These stimuli are repeated several times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and only one evoked potential is estimated inside the temporal window of interest. Consequently, the average estimation does not take into account other neural responses within the same epoch that are due to short inter stimuli intervals. These adjacent neural responses may overlap and distort the evoked potential of interest. This overlapping process is a significant issue for the eye fixation-related potential (EFRP) technique in which the epochs are time-locked on the ocular fixations. The inter fixation intervals are not experimentally controlled and can be shorter than the neural response's latency. To begin, the Tikhonov regularization, applied to the classical average estimation, was introduced to improve the SNR for a given number of trials. The generalized cross validation was chosen to obtain the optimal value of the ridge parameter. Then, to deal with the issue of overlapping, the general linear model (GLM), was used to extract all neural responses inside an epoch. Finally, the regularization was also applied to it. The models (the classical average and the GLM with and without regularization) were compared on both simulated data and real datasets from a visual scene exploration in co-registration with an eye-tracker, and from a P300 Speller experiment. The regularization was found to improve the estimation by average for a given number of trials. The GLM was more robust and efficient, its efficiency actually reinforced by the regularization.},

These challenges have led the community to develop a variety of preprocessing and analytical (almost exclusively linear) methods, each designed to tackle one of these issues. Instead, we propose to address these challenges through a specific end-to-end deep learning architecture, trained to predict the MEG responses of multiple subjects at once. We successfully test this approach on a large cohort of MEG recordings acquired during a one-hour reading task. Our Deep Recurrent Encoder (DRE) reliably predicts MEG responses to words with a three-fold improvement over classic linear methods. We further describe a simple variable importance analysis to investigate the MEG representations learnt by our model and recover the expected evoked responses to word length and word frequency. Last, we show that, contrary to linear encoders, our model captures modulations of the brain response in relation to baseline fluctuations in the alpha frequency band. The quantitative improvement of the present deep learning approach paves the way to a better characterization of the complex dynamics of brain activity from large MEG datasets.},

A repeated trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

Here, we show that two behavioral metrics---reaction time (RT) and confidence---can be decoded across the cortex when each individual is considered separately. Subjects (N = 50) completed a perceptual decision-making task with confidence. We built models decoding trial-level RT and confidence separately for each subject using the activation patterns in one brain area at a time after splitting the entire cortex into 200 regions of interest (ROIs). First, we developed a simple test to determine the robustness of decoding performance, which showed that several hundred trials per subject are required for robust decoding. We then examined the decoding performance at the group and subject levels. At the group level, we replicated previous results by showing that both RT and confidence could be decoded from a small number of ROIs (12.0\% and 3.5\%, respectively). Critically, at the subject level, both RT and confidence could be decoded from most brain regions even after Bonferroni correction (90.0\% and 72.5\%, respectively). Surprisingly, we observed that many brain regions exhibited opposite brain-behavior relationships across individuals, such that, for example, higher activations predicted fast RTs in some subjects but slow RTs in others. All results were replicated in a second dataset. These findings show that behavioral signatures can be decoded from a much broader range of cortical areas than previously recognized and suggest the need to study the brain-behavior relationship at both the group and subject levels.},

In this review, we first assess the feasibility of mobile paradigms, including electrode selection, artifact correction techniques, and methodological considerations. This review underscores the importance of ecological, construct, and predictive validity in ensuring the trustworthiness and applicability of mobile EEG findings. Second, we explore studies on attention in naturalistic settings, focusing on replicating classic P3 component studies in mobile paradigms like stationary biking in our lab, and activities such as walking, cycling, and dual-tasking outside of the lab. We emphasize how the mobile approach complements traditional laboratory paradigms and the types of insights gained in naturalistic research settings. Third, we discuss promising applications of portable EEG in workplace safety and other areas including road safety, rehabilitation medicine, and brain-computer interfaces. In summary, this review explores the expanding possibilities of mobile EEG while recognizing the existing challenges in fully realizing its potential.},

  abstract = {Free gaze and moving images are typically avoided in EEG experiments due to the expected generation of artifacts and noise. Yet for a growing number of research questions, loosening these rigorous restrictions would be beneficial. Among these is research on visual aesthetic experiences, which often involve open-ended exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we systematically compare the effect of conservative vs. more liberal experimental settings on various measures of behavior, brain activity and physiology in an aesthetic rating task. Our primary aim was to assess EEG signal quality. 43 participants either maintained fixation or were allowed to gaze freely, and viewed either static images or dynamic (video) stimuli consisting of dance performances or nature scenes. A passive auditory background task (auditory steady-state response; ASSR) was added as a proxy measure for overall EEG recording quality. We recorded EEG, ECG and eye tracking data, and participants rated their aesthetic preference and state of boredom on each trial. Whereas both behavioral ratings and gaze behavior were affected by task and stimulus manipulations, EEG SNR was barely affected and generally robust across all conditions, despite only minimal preprocessing and no trial rejection. In particular, we show that using video stimuli does not necessarily result in lower EEG quality and can, on the contrary, significantly reduce eye movements while increasing both the participants' aesthetic response and general task engagement. We see these as encouraging results indicating that - at least in the lab - more liberal experimental conditions can be adopted without significant loss of signal quality.},

Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global--local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

  abstract = {Head motion during functional MRI (fMRI) scanning can induce spurious findings and/or harm detection of true effects. Solutions have been proposed, including deleting (`scrubbing') or regressing out (`spike regression') motion volumes from fMRI time-series. These strategies remove motion-induced signal variations at the cost of destroying the autocorrelation structure of the fMRI time-series and reducing temporal degrees of freedom. ICA-based fMRI denoising strategies overcome these drawbacks but typically require re-training of a classifier, needing manual labeling of derived components (e.g. ICA-FIX; Salimi-Khorshidi et al. (2014)). Here, we propose an ICA-based strategy for Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA) that uses a small (n=4), but robust set of theoretically motivated temporal and spatial features. Our strategy does not require classifier re-training, retains the data's autocorrelation structure and largely preserves temporal degrees of freedom. We describe ICA-AROMA, its implementation, and initial validation. ICA-AROMA identified motion components with high accuracy and robustness as illustrated by leave-N-out cross-validation. We additionally validated ICA-AROMA in resting-state (100 participants) and task-based fMRI data (118 participants). Our approach removed (motion-related) spurious noise from both rfMRI and task-based fMRI data to larger extent than regression using 24 motion parameters or spike regression. Furthermore, ICA-AROMA increased sensitivity to group-level activation. Our results show that ICA-AROMA effectively reduces motion-induced signal variations in fMRI data, is applicable across datasets without requiring classifier re-training, and preserves the temporal characteristics of the fMRI data.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONNeuroergonomics as defined by Raja Parasuraman is the study of \&quot;the brain at work and in everyday life\&quot; (Parasuraman, 2003). This rapidly growing research field aims at understanding human brain function underlying the many facets of human interaction with technical systems (Dehais et al., 2020). The term “cognition” is used to describe different processes (e.g. attention, memory, decision making) relevant to human-technology interaction. Cognitive neuroergonomics, then, can be defined as a section of neuroergonomics concerned with the investigation of the neural bases of those cognitive processes involved in the user’s interaction with a technical system at work or during everyday life. One of the defining aspects of cognitive neuroergonomics is that it uses insights from analyzing neural dynamics in these settings to inform cognitive theory and models, as well as to improve our understanding of human brain function underlying cognition, in general. To this end, new imaging methods are continuously adapted and used in a wide range of experimental scenarios that cover the entire area of ergonomics from highly controlled laboratory research protocols, to less controlled translational research, to research in the real world with little control over the factors of interest (Parada, 2018). This decreasing level of control is accompanied by an increasing level of ecological validity. Laboratory experiments provide very good control over experimental factors with high internal validity of the investigated constructs but often suffer from low levels of ecological validity. In contrast, real-world experiments might show low internal validity and lack of experimental control but provide high ecological validity that cannot be further improved. Here, the real world is the laboratory (Gramann et al., 2017). Furthermore, with increasing ecological validity, inter-acting with technical systems often involves expanding physical activity of the user. System interactions range from very low input (e.g., interaction with mobile devices; McKendrick, 2019) to larger scale interaction (e.g., Human-Robot Interaction, HRI; Tsarouchi et al., 2016) to very large scale interactions (e.g., assisted navigation; Wunderlich \&amp; Gramann, 2020). Active behavior is the basis for physically demanding workplaces as well as less physically challenging tasks that, nonetheless, require body, head and eye movements when users actively seek information or respond to external stimuli (Doshi \&amp; Trivedi, 2009). Traditionally, however, active behavior is not allowed in brain imaging protocols because established imaging modalities are usually too heavy to follow participants’ movements and movement-related artifacts render the analyses of neural activity difficult (Gramann et al., 2011; Makeig et al., 2009). With cognitive neuroergonomics maturing into a new research area with widespread research questions and methods, the focus should be put back into theory-driven studies of the human brain at work and in everyday life. Good scientific practices have to be adapted to allow for replicable science including the integration of new mobile imaging methods into the existing range of established imaging protocols. New findings have to be related to parameters known from established laboratory protocols and integrated into larger theoretical frameworks that allow for systematic replication as well as the development of robust parameters reflecting cognitive processes. From this perspective, it is our belief that the following challenges will have to be met to further develop this scientific field.Challenge 1: Bridging Basic, Translational, and Applied Research in Cognitive NeuroergonomicsTraditionally, research in cognitive neuroergonomics takes place in different environments spanning the entire space of protocols from fundamental to applied research (Figure 1). Fundamental research questions can be addressed in controlled laboratory settings and translated towards work environments (e.g., Gateau et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020). In translational research, often expensive high-fidelity simulations are used to investigate more realistic cognitive and behavioral dynamics (Baldwin et al., 2017). These environments enable sufficient control over confounding factors while permitting repetitions of simulation scenarios to gain sufficient statistical power for analyzing a specific cognitive process of interest (Hollnagel, 2010). Finally, applied research takes place during interaction with technology in real-world settings which often do not allow for controlling how users interact with the system, providing limited or no control over external factors contributing to the behavior of users (Dehais et al., 2019). Over the last decades, the majority of neuroergonomic studies took place in laboratories that provided the necessary infrastructure and housing for the heavy and susceptible imaging technologies. With the rise of lightweight mobile amplifiers, however, an increasing number of studies moved out of the lab using imaging methods in real-world settings (Chavarriaga et al., 2018; McKendrick et al., 2017; Protzak \&amp; Gramann, 2018).All three areas of research in neuroergonomics are important and eventually converge to understand the cognitive and neural basis of human-technology interaction. To assure objectivity, reliability, and validity of the methods used, neuroergonomic studies have to allow for replication and falsifiability as two necessary pillars of a healthy scientific field that help to facilitate replication of key findings in the future.Besides implementing good scientific practices, bridging fundamental and applied studies in cognitive neuroergonomics can be achieved through the use of virtual reality (VR). VR allows for creating fully controlled and accurate virtual copies of real scenarios which are too expensive, dangerous or impossible to create in a standard experimental laboratory (Jeunet et al., 2018; e.g., Shi et al., 2020). VR can be useful to the design of technological interfaces leading to a reduction of research costs when compared to real scenarios (Chryssolouris et al., 2000). VR systems currently come with critical limitations including lower levels of fidelity when compared to real world scenarios (Hu et al., 2011), the lack of proper haptic feedback (Faure et al., 2020) and simulation sickness for a non-negligible percentage of the population (Dużmańska et al., 2018). But, VR technologies are rapidly improving and provide possible solutions to minimize many problems associated with low control, expensive access, and insufficient sample sizes in translational and applied neuroergonomics research in the next decades.Challenge 2: Imaging Methods for Embodied Cognitive NeuroergonomicsThe majority of workplaces and interfaces require active behavior for successful interaction with a system. The programming and execution of motor action influences cognition as well as accompanying brain dynamics and it is thus imperative to understand cognitive processes during inter-action with a system (Gramann et al., 2011; Jungnickel \&amp; Gramann, 2016). Mobile brain imaging approaches from mobile EEG (Gramann \&amp; Plank, 2019) and fNRIS (Izzetoglu et al., 2005) to Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (Jungnickel et al., 2019) allow for imaging human brain dynamics in actively behaving participants interacting with a technical system. Lightweight and mobile amplifiers exist for EEG and fNIRS that can be further combined and synchronized with additional physiological measures, motion capture, and other methods. Because of the active behavior of participants in mobile recordings, the acquired data is often contaminated with activity stemming from non-brain sources, usually considered artifact. Most mobile brain imaging studies thus require careful pre-processing of the recorded data (for EEG, see Klug \&amp; Gramann, 2020; for fNRIS, see Yibo Zhu et al., 2020) and data-driven analyses to dissociate brain from non-brain activity (Makeig et al., 2009; Vitorio et al., 2017 for EEG and fNRIS, respectively). The increasing demands in preparation, technical challenges, and data analyses come with deeper insights into human brain dynamics only if the challenges of new mobile brain imaging methods can be overcome.Even though improved mobile brain imaging methods allow for investigating naturalistic interactions with technical systems in the workplace and everyday settings (Gehrke et al., 2019; Wascher et al., 2020), these new methods likely come with potential changes in the extracted neural parameters (Gramann et al., 2018). Such differences have to be described and embedded in a systematic fashion to allow for understanding the theoretical and methodological framework and to foster convergence with results from standard laboratory protocols, leading directly to the third grand field challenge.Challenge 3: Generalizability of Physiological Parameters Reflecting Cognitive ProcessesA variety of neurophysiological parameters have been identified in different experiments with diverging interpretations regarding their cognitive correlates. The advent of new imaging modalities and analysis approaches that allow for brain imaging in actively behaving participants, led to the discovery of new neural dynamics. It is important to embed new and diverging results in a theoretical framework rather than just accumulating new parameters that are disconnected from existing knowledge and established theory. It is an eminent challenge in cognitive neuroergonomics to systematically compare physiological parameters across experimental tasks and neuroscientific methods to allow for identifying parameters that represent cognitive processes or user states independently of the tasks and methods used. In general, the eventual outcome of neurergonomic research, like any other research, should be a falsifiable model or theory that allows for predicting user behavior or user states based on neurophysiological data. If the model is successful in its predictions it is more likely to eventually provide generalizability (Baldwin \&amp; Penaranda, 2012). A systematic and concerted approach in the field of cognitive neuroergonomics should be able overcome some of these limitations. Advances in algorithms and data labeling have begun to show promise in these areas (McKendrick et al., 2019).Challenge 4: Open Access to Data and Protocols in NeuroergonomicsReproducible scientific insights are essential to a democratic discourse and provide the basis for the design of a human-centered technology. Open Access (OA) approaches have been established over the last years to counteract restrictive paywalled scientific publication models that often come with high publication costs in established journals currently dominating science. While open access is an important and central aspect of barrier-free knowledge distribution, several additional aspects of publishing should be considered for a reproducible, transparent, and self-controlling scientific system. For scientific practice to be reproducible and transparent, the experimental procedures, collected data and analyses approaches/code have to be published in combination with the manuscripts so that other researchers can replicate and test the results of a neuroergonomic study. Data sharing is beneficial to the neuroscience community in general (Sejnowski et al., 2014), but comes with its own hurdles including standardization of data formats, incentives to share data as well as its discoverability, among others (Wiener et al., 2016). Publication of data, protocols and code in open repositories (e.g., Github, OSF) might face opposition in some research areas due to, for example, financial interest or security restrictions in applied industrial research. Even where no such restrictions exist, such as in basic research pursuits, reproducibility and transparency practices are not yet the norm. To achieve these goals, it is fundamental to apply standardised approaches that have been developed in different scientific communities and for different modalities over the last years regarding data formatting (e.g. EEG-BIDS, Pernet et al., 2019) and reporting (e.g., CRED-NF for neurofeedback, Ros et al., 2020), alongside guidelines for data analyses and sharing (e.g., COBIDAS, Pernet et al., 2020). These formats and guidelines should be considered as future standards for neuroergonomics to allow for objective checks and balances in this rapidly growing scientific field. Finally, registered reports could be a future gold standard for reproducible basic research in cognitive neuroergonomics to allow for careful planning with sufficient sample sizes providing unbiased results and hopefully more valid neurophysiological parameters that reflect cognitive processes during interaction with technical systems.CONCLUSIONThe rapidly growing scientific field of cognitive neuroergonomics benefits from new neuroscientific methods and technologies that allow bridging basic to applied research. Mobile imaging modalities in real world settings or near-realistic VR environments provide the opportunity to understand brain activity associated with natural interactions with technical systems. They also provide new opportunities to understand human brain functions associated with cognitive processes during active behavior in dynamically changing environments. These new technological opportunities will come with novel insights into the neural basis of cognitive states and processes. Reproducible scientific approaches in neuroergonomics based on open access and open protocols as well as open data will help to overcome some challenges of these new approaches allowing to address problems of replicability in the field (Stanley, Carter, \&amp; Doucouliagos, 2018; Barch \&amp; Yarkoni, 2013). This way, cognitive neuroergonomics might provide new and applicable insights to improve human well-being when interacting with technical systems at work or during leisure.},
